Team grouped up together quickly and collected the authentic data from various NGOs and counselors who deals with Autistic people.  Application is designed in very user-friendly manner keeping in mind the capabilities of person with ASD and will open the doors for people associated with ASD child and adult as a parents and caretakers. This is surely a great initiative and my best wishes are with the Team Aurtistic."</string>
